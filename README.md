# OCR-D Pipeline for ECPO

**Work in Progress**

## Prerequisites

* Python `==3.10` (others might work, but this is what we tests. Very recent versions do not work.)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ssciwr/ecpo_ocrd.git
cd ecpo_ocrd
python -m pip install .
ecpo_ocrd install
```

## Usage

Before doing anything, at the `bin` folder to `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```
